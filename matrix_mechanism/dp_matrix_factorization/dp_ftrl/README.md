# DP-FTRL in Federated Learning

## Overview

Implements and experiments with DP-FTRLM (momentum variant of differentially
private follow-the-regularized-leader) in federated learning.

The algorithmic details for DP-FTRLM were first described in "Practical and
Private (Deep) Learning without Sampling or Shuffling"
([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00039)).
